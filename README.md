<p align="center">A <b>Solution Challenge</b> Submission</p>.

<p align="center">UniCare is an app made to help students get easy access to therapists and counselors on campus. It contains a reporting functionality to make an SOS call to nearby police, hospitals or fire service in case of an emergency. We believe that this is a necessary step in bringing down the death-rate due to suicide and depression in our community.</p>

#### Designs

All the design/mockups for the app have been added in the `designs` directory. You can use those for reference.

### Description
 - Our solution mainly consists of a Flutter based mobile app. We wanted
   our solution to reach the masses, that's why we picked flutter as our
   framework of choice because of its cross-platform capabilities.
  
  - For the backend, we mostly relied on Firebase, as it was easier to
   integrate with the flutter app, without any hassle to manage & create
   instances of our server. 
   
  - For sign-ups & authentication, we used Firebase authentication.
   
  - For storing the different types of data including user data, we chose Cloud Firestore because of its robust
   features and ability to query & filter out documents with ease.
